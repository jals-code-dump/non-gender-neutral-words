# non-gender-neutral-words
Non-gender neutral word collection for NLP

This project is about creating an open-source resource for identifying non-gender neutral terminology and suggesting alternative words.

The idea is to keep the file as a .csv so that it's usuable in any language.

I'm looking for collaborators to help add more content. This may be terms i have missed out or by giving suggestions for alternative terminology in a format of "alt1, alt2, alt3".

Let's work together to reduce gender bias and increase inclusivity!
